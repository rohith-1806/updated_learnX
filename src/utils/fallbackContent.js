      { name: "Introduction to HTML5 & Document Structure", content: "HTML5 is the standard markup language for Web pages. A basic HTML structure begins with <!DOCTYPE html> followed by <html>, <head> containing metadata/title, and <body> containing visual layouts. Semantic tags like <header>, <nav>, <main>, <section>, and <footer> provide meaningful context to the document tree, making websites readable for crawlers and assistive devices." },

Essential elements include <input> with various types (text, email, password, radio, checkbox, submit), <label> linked via the 'for' attribute, and <textarea>. Attributes like 'required', 'placeholder', 'maxlength', and 'pattern' help perform client-side constraints out-of-the-box before submitting headers." },
      { name: "Semantic Elements and HTML5 Features", content: "HTML5 introduced clean structural outlines to replace generic <div> blocks. Elements like <article> define self-contained articles, <aside> marks auxiliary sidebars, and <figure>/<figcaption> group media assets. Additionally, structural helpers like <details> and <summary> provide native accordions directly in the browser markup." },
